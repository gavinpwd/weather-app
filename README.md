**You can view the web app here:  https://gavinpwd.github.io/weather-app/
This app was inspired by the painting of Caspar David Friedrich "Wanderer Above a Sea of Fog (1818)", awe-inspiring and genre-defining painting German Romantic art.**

**This weather web app was created using the following:**

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Bootstrap v4.5.2
Unsplash API
Google Fonts API

**My Design Goals:**

UI and UX should convey sense of fun and happiness
A simple web layout with easy to use search bar
Typography should be well-considered
Strategic use of colours and icons
Use of simple icons, bright colours and full screen image
Show results like cards from left to right
Mobile-friendly layout
Consider using floating elements, transparency, opacity, shadows

**My Coding Goals:**

Use comments strategically
Codes should be well organised and easy to read
Utilise documentation from Bootstrap, MDN and W3CSchools website
Reference any external code sources used
Use at least one API as part of the project

**Trajectory of this project:**

This project was beyond the MVP requirement
Resolve the Melbourne search issue - use a suggested list or geo-location API
Adding a close button for each card result
Add a compare, save and delete feature

**Stretch Goal:**

Create a Mobile app version that can be downloaded via mobile app store
